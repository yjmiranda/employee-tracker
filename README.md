# Employee Tracker

A command line interface that makes it easy to access a company's employee database. 

## Getting Started

You can download this repository by clicking on the "Clone or download" button, then click on the "Download Zip" button. Then extract the files to your desired directory.

### Prerequisites

This interface runs on Node and uses the "inquirer", "console.table", and "mysql" packages.

To install node follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To install the package dependencies, navigate to the "employee-tracker-master" directory in the command terminal, then type "npm install" and press ENTER. A "node_modules" folder should appear in the "employee-tracker-master" directory.

```
path/to/employee-tracker-master npm install
```
The databases are rendered using SQL. You can use [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) to handle the SQL files. The "schema.sql" and "seed.sql" found within the assets/sql directory can be used to create and populate the database.

## Deployment

To start the app, simply type "node employee-tracker.js" into the command terminal and press ENTER.

```
path/to/employee-tracker-master node employee-tracker.js
```
